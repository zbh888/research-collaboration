# Affiliation Extraction

1. Follow the [link](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Install-Grobid/) to build grobid (I used gradle option)

2. Follow the [link](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid_client_python) to install Python client server usage

3. In the directory from step-1, you should be able to use gradle to run the application. (Intellij would help).

4. After you run the application from step-3, the server should start locally. Check out http://localhost:8070

5. Go to the directory from step-2, run `python3 example.py`, the output would be in `resources/test_out`
